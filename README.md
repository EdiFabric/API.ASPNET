# EdiNation InHouse API for ASP .NET Core

## 1. Overview
EdiNation InHouse EDI API allows you to run EdiNation's EDI translation and validation API in your own cloud or on-prem environment(s).  
This tutorial uses the example ASP .NET Core solution that comes with the EdiNation Inhouse product.  

## 2. Requirements
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), which supports .NET 6.0.

- EDI test file(s) - the API supports X12, EDIFACT, EANCOM, HL7, NCPDP, VDA, and EDIGAS. If you don't have a test file, use one of ours - [X12 HIPAA](https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/sections/360001487352-X12-HIPAA-Files-Templates), [X12](https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/sections/360005274077-X12-Files-Templates), [EDIFACT](https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/sections/360005274137-EDIFACT-Files-Templates).
